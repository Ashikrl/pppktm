<p>Getting on the RCâ€™s saddle, you immediately recall KTMâ€™s tagline, â€˜Ready to Raceâ€™. The RCâ€™s seating is as committed as it can get thanks to the low set clip-ons and the high-ish saddle height. If youâ€™re thinking of going fast all the time, this is just the right riding position, however for the times when youâ€™re not, you will curse the RC. The seat is actually a plank of wood disguised as a seat and the aggressive riding position means plenty of weight on your wrist, which after long hours of riding will start getting to you. This is where the R3 shines. Immediately after the RC, the R3â€™s riding position feels like getting on an upright motorcycle. And Iâ€™m not kidding the RC really is that committed. The seat is perfect with the right amount of cushioning and the foot-pegs arenâ€™t too rear-set either giving it a comfortable riding position which even after hours of riding is not half as bad as riding the RC.</p>
